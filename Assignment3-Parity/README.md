# Assignment 3 - Parity

Design and write an assembly language program that will calculate the parity bit for a 7 bit value stored in r0. 

The program should then store the computed parity bit in bit 7 of r0. Assume even parity.

Using even parity, the parity bit of a value is set such that the number of set bits (1's) in a value is always even.
