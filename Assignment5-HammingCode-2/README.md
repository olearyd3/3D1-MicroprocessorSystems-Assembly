# Assignment 5
Design and write an assembly language program that will detect and correct single bit errors in a 12-bit Hamming Code in R0. Your program should begin by clearing and then re-calculating the check bits using the same assembly language program that was used to generate the original Hamming Code. Your program should then compare the original and re-calculated values and should finally correct any single bit error and store the correct 8 bit number in R0.
